# Quickstart

## Installing `nur`

If you are familiar with `rust`/`cargo` you may want to install `nur` using `cargo`:

```nushell
> cargo install nur
```

See [installation]({% link installation.md %}) for more details on how to install `nur`.

## Add a `nurfile` to your project

You should add a file called `nurfile` to your project root folder. Add this file to version control
as well, to share your tasks with your team. You can also extend the available tasks locally by
adding a separate `nurfile.local` file to your project.

## Adding some tasks

`nur` tasks are defined by using sub commands to `nur` in your `nurfile`, following the normal
`nu` syntax using `def`. A simple task could look like this:

```nushell
def "nur hello" [] {
    print "Hello world"
}
```

You can then use `nur hello` to execute this task. Tasks may call external command like `npm ci`
or `poetry install` or anything else you like. Tasks can also call other tasks, see the
[working with nur]({% link working-with-nur/index.md %}) section for more details.

{: .note }
All tasks will be executed in the directory the `nurfile` was found in. If you place a `nurfile`
in your project root (git root) you will be able to call tasks from anywhere inside the project.
This is useful to always have a reproducible base setup for all your tasks.

### About task names

It is recommended to define and use a naming schema for your tasks. This could for example be
something like:

- `nur install`: Setup the project, install all dependencies
- `nur update`: Update the project, update all dependencies
- `nur test`: Run all tests
- `nur lint`: Lint the project
- `nur run`: Run the project, for web project start the dev server
- etc.

See [best practices]({% link best-practices.md %}) for more details on how to structure your tasks.

## Switching to `nur` from any other task runner

If you are already using a task runner like `just` or `b5` you should read
[switching to nur]({% link switching-to-nur.md %}) to get an overview on how to switch to `nur`.
